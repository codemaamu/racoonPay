# RaccoonPay - Charitable Donation Transparency Platform

## Overview

RaccoonPay is a blockchain-based platform designed to enhance transparency, accountability, and trust in charitable donations. This README provides an overview of the project, detailing the implementation of smart contracts, the user-friendly front-end, and the blockchain-based transaction recording system.

## Features

- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts ensure transparent, automated fund allocation and immutable transaction recording.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly web interface enables donors to initiate transactions and access impact reports.
- **Blockchain Technology**: RaccoonPay utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for secure, decentralized transaction storage.
- **Database Integration**: Transaction data is efficiently stored in a relational database for analysis.
- **Behavior Analysis**: The system employs behavior analysis techniques to detect and identify suspicious activities.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

2. **Smart Contract Development**: Develop smart contracts using Solidity for donation processing.

3. **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the smart contracts.

4. **Blockchain Integration**: Utilize Ganache for local blockchain development and testing.

5. **Database Management**: Implement a database for efficient transaction data storage.

6. **Behavior Analysis**: Develop algorithms to analyze transaction behavior for suspicious activity detection.

## Usage

- Launch the front-end to enable donors to initiate transactions and access impact reports.
- Transactions are securely recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
- The database stores transaction data for further analysis.

## Results and Future Work

The RaccoonPay project has successfully addressed transparency issues in charitable donations, providing a secure and accountable platform for donors and organizations. Future work may involve scalability improvements, additional security measures, and enhanced behavior analysis capabilities.
